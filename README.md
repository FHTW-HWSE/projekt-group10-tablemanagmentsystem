Reservation System for Local Businesses

## Introduction

In light of recent events, it has become apparent that it will be important to keep track of where people have been in the future. To this end, a reservation system for local businesses must be developed. This reservation system must be able to record neighboring seating groups. Since not every venue looks the same, it must be possible to specify the position of each table. It must also be possible to determine retroactively which tables were occupied at a distance of less than a certain distance from a requested table. To keep the effort low, only one contact person must be saved per table. It can also be assumed that a reservation never includes more guests than the possible number of seats at the table.

## Requirements

The following tasks must be fulfilled by the program:

- Implementation of a user interface
- Adding and removing tables by specifying Cartesian coordinates
- Allocation of a table when specifying a contact person
- Saving the table and the contact person
- Querying all occupied tables when specifying a table and a distance.

## Usage

The program can be used by running the executable file. The user interface allows the user to perform the required tasks, such as adding and removing tables, allocating tables to customers, and querying occupied tables.
